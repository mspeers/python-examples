LCM

Given two integers, return the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers.

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers. For example, given 4 and 6, return 12 because:

    Multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12 and so on.
    Multplies of 6 are 6, 12, 18 and so on.
    12 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

def lcm(a, b):
    greater = max(a, b)
    smallest = min(a, b)
    for i in range(greater, a*b+1, greater):
        if i % smallest == 0:
            return i 
            
'''
1. lcm(4, 6) should return 12.
2. lcm(9, 6) should return 18.
Waiting: 3. lcm(10, 100) should return 100.
Waiting: 4. lcm(13, 17) should return 221.
Waiting: 5. lcm(45, 70) should return 630.
