# Python 2D Dice grid

### infomation

4 by 4 grid of dice


Rules:

Once the new grid is set, its score can be calculated by identifying specific patterns as follows:

-    Start with a score of 0,
-    If all four corners are even numbers, add 20 pts to the score,
-    If all four corners are odd numbers, add 20 pts to the score,
-    If all four dice on a diagonal are even numbers, add 20 pts to the score,
-    If all four dice on a diagonal are odd numbers, add 20 pts to the score,
-    If all four dice on on any row are even numbers, add 20 pts to the score,
-    If all four dice on on any row are odd numbers, add 20 pts to the score,
-    If all four dice on on any column are even numbers, add 20 pts to the score,
-    If all four dice on on any column are odd numbers, add 20 pts to the score,
-    Add to the score the total value (sum) of all 16 dice.
